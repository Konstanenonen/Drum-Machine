Play sounds by clicking the buttons or by using keyboard. Displays my best imitation of every sound. This was one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) learning projects for their JavaScript frameworks course.
